    "## What is Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a modern, open source, object-oriented programming language, created by a Dutch programmer, Guido van Rossum. Officially, it is an **interpreted** scripting language (meaning that it is not compiled until it is run) for the C programming language; in fact, Python itself is coded in C (though there are other non-C implementations). Frequently, it is compared to languages like Perl and Ruby. It offers the power and flexibility of lower level (*i.e.* compiled) languages, without the steep learning curve, and without most of the associated programming overhead. The language is very clean and readable, and it is available for almost every modern computing platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use Python for scientific programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python offers a number of advantages to scientists, both for experienced and novice programmers alike:\n",
    "\n",
    "***Powerful and easy to use***  \n",
    "Python is simultaneously powerful, flexible and easy to learn and use (in general, these qualities are traded off for a given programming language). Anything that can be coded in C, FORTRAN, or Java can be done in Python, almost always in fewer lines of code, and with fewer debugging headaches. Its standard library is extremely rich, including modules for string manipulation, regular expressions, file compression, mathematics, profiling and debugging (to name only a few). Unnecessary language constructs, such as `END` statements and brackets are absent, making the code terse, efficient, and easy to read. Finally, Python is object-oriented, which is an important programming paradigm particularly well-suited to scientific programming, which allows data structures to be abstracted in a natural way.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Interactive***  \n",
    "Python may be run interactively on the command line, in much the same way as Octave or S-Plus/R. Rather than compiling and running a particular program, commands may entered serially followed by the `Return` key. This is often useful for mathematical programming and debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Extensible***  \n",
    "Python is often referred to as a “glue” language, meaning that it is a useful in a mixed-language environment. Frequently, programmers must interact with colleagues that operate in other programming languages, or use significant quantities of legacy code that would be problematic or expensive to re-code. Python was designed to interact with other programming languages, and in many cases C or FORTRAN code can be compiled directly into Python programs (using utilities such as `f2py` or `weave`). Additionally, since Python is an interpreted language, it can sometimes be slow relative to its compiled cousins. In many cases this performance deficit is due to a short loop of code that runs thousands or millions of times. Such bottlenecks may be removed by coding a function in FORTRAN, C or Cython, and compiling it into a Python module.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Third-party modules***  \n",
    "There is a vast body of Python modules created outside the auspices of the Python Software Foundation. These include utilities for database connectivity, mathematics, statistics, and charting/plotting. Some notables include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ***NumPy***: Numerical Python (NumPy) is a set of extensions that provides the ability to specify and manipulate array data structures. It provides array manipulation and computational capabilities similar to those found in Matlab or Octave. \n",
    "* ***SciPy***: An open source library of scientific tools for Python, SciPy supplements the NumPy module. SciPy gathering a variety of high level science and engineering modules together as a single package. SciPy includes modules for graphics and plotting, optimization, integration, special functions, signal and image processing, genetic algorithms, ODE solvers, and others.\n",
    "* ***Matplotlib***: Matplotlib is a python 2D plotting library which produces publication-quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. Its syntax is very similar to Matlab. \n",
    "* ***Pandas***: A module that provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools. In particular, the `DataFrame` class is useful for spreadsheet-like representation and mannipulation of data. Also includes high-level plotting functionality.\n",
    "* ***IPython***: An enhanced Python shell, designed to increase the efficiency and usability of coding, testing and debugging Python. It includes both a Qt-based console and an interactive HTML notebook interface, both of which feature multiline editing, interactive plotting and syntax highlighting.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Free and open***  \n",
    "Python is released on all platforms under an open license (Python Software Foundation License), meaning that the language and its source is freely distributable. Not only does this keep costs down for scientists and universities operating  under a limited budget, but it also frees programmers from licensing concerns for any software they may develop. There is little reason to buy expensive licenses for software such as Matlab or Maple, when Python can provide the same functionality for free!\n"
